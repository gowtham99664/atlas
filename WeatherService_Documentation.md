package com.smarthome.service;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;
```

**What's happening here?**
- **Package Declaration**: Places this class in the `com.smarthome.service` package, organizing it with other service classes
- **Time Handling**: `LocalDateTime` and `DateTimeFormatter` for managing weather forecast timestamps
- **Collections**: `ArrayList` and `List` for storing weather data and automation rules
- **Utilities**: `Random` for simulating weather variations and `Scanner` for user input collection

---

## Class Declaration and Singleton Pattern

```java
public class WeatherService {
    private static WeatherService instance;
    private final Random random;
    private WeatherData currentUserWeather;
    private final Scanner scanner;

    private WeatherService() {
        this.random = new Random();
        this.scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        this.currentUserWeather = null;
    }

    public static synchronized WeatherService getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new WeatherService();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

**Design Pattern: Singleton Implementation**

**What is the Singleton Pattern?**
The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of WeatherService exists throughout the entire application lifecycle. Think of it like having only one weather station for your entire smart home system.

**Why use Singleton here?**
1. **Resource Management**: Weather data should be consistent across all parts of the application
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Prevents multiple weather service instances from consuming unnecessary memory
3. **Data Consistency**: Ensures all components access the same weather information
4. **Thread Safety**: The `synchronized` keyword prevents multiple threads from creating duplicate instances

**Real-world Analogy**: Like having one central weather monitoring station for your entire neighborhood - everyone gets the same accurate weather information from the single authoritative source.

**Code Breakdown**:
- `private static WeatherService instance`: Holds the single instance of the class
- `private WeatherService()`: Private constructor prevents external instantiation
- `synchronized getInstance()`: Thread-safe method to retrieve the single instance
- `Random random`: Generates realistic weather variations for simulation
- `Scanner scanner`: Handles user input for weather data collection

## Inner Class: WeatherData

```java
public static class WeatherData {
    private double temperature;
    private int humidity;
    private String condition;
    private double windSpeed;
    private int airQualityIndex;
    private String location;
    private LocalDateTime lastUpdated;

    public WeatherData(double temperature, int humidity, String condition,
                      double windSpeed, int airQualityIndex, String location) {
        this.temperature = temperature;
        this.humidity = humidity;
        this.condition = condition;
        this.windSpeed = windSpeed;
        this.airQualityIndex = airQualityIndex;
        this.location = location;
        this.lastUpdated = LocalDateTime.now();
    }
}
```

**What is this Inner Class?**
`WeatherData` is a data container (also called a "data class" or "POJO" - Plain Old Java Object) that stores comprehensive weather information.

**Why use an Inner Class?**
1. **Encapsulation**: Weather data is tightly coupled with WeatherService functionality
2. **Organization**: Keeps related data structures close to their usage
3. **Access Control**: Can access outer class methods and variables when needed

**Weather Parameters Explained**:
- **Temperature**: Measured in Celsius, affects heating/cooling device automation
- **Humidity**: Percentage (0-100%), influences air conditioning and dehumidifier control
- **Condition**: Descriptive weather state (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.)
- **Wind Speed**: Measured in km/h, affects window and ventilation control
- **Air Quality Index**: Scale 0-300+, determines air purifier automation needs
- **Location**: Geographic reference for weather data accuracy
- **Last Updated**: Timestamp ensuring data freshness

**Real-world Usage Example**:
```java
WeatherData currentWeather = new WeatherData(22.5, 65, "Partly Cloudy", 15.2, 45, "New York");
// This creates a weather snapshot: 22.5°C, 65% humidity, partly cloudy conditions
```

---

## Inner Class: WeatherAutomationRule

```java
public static class WeatherAutomationRule {
    private String condition;
    private String deviceAction;
    private String reasoning;

    public WeatherAutomationRule(String condition, String deviceAction, String reasoning) {
        this.condition = condition;
        this.deviceAction = deviceAction;
        this.reasoning = reasoning;
    }
}
```

**What is an Automation Rule?**
This class represents intelligent decision-making logic that connects weather conditions to smart home device actions.

**Components Breakdown**:
- **Condition**: The weather trigger (e.g., "temperature > 30°C")
- **Device Action**: The recommended smart home response (e.g., "Turn on AC")
- **Reasoning**: Human-readable explanation for the automation logic

**Real-world Example**:
```java
WeatherAutomationRule rule = new WeatherAutomationRule(
    "High Humidity (>70%)",
    "Turn on Dehumidifier and AC",
    "High humidity can cause discomfort and mold growth"
);
```

## Core Weather Data Collection Method

```java
public void updateWeatherData() {
    System.out.println("\n=== Weather Data Collection ===");
    System.out.println("Please provide current weather information for your location:");

    try {
        System.out.print("Temperature (°C): ");
        double temperature = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextLine().trim());

        System.out.print("Humidity (%): ");
        int humidity = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine().trim());
        // ... validation and input collection continues
    }
}
```

**Interactive Data Collection Process**

**Why Manual Input?**
1. **Accuracy**: Users provide hyperlocal weather conditions
2. **Flexibility**: Works without internet connectivity or weather APIs
3. **User Engagement**: Makes users aware of environmental conditions affecting their home
4. **Customization**: Allows for specific microclimate considerations

**Input Validation Features**:
- **Temperature Range**: Validates realistic temperature values (-50°C to 60°C)
- **Humidity Bounds**: Ensures percentage values (0-100%)
- **Condition Selection**: Provides predefined weather condition options
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully manages invalid inputs with retry mechanisms

**Code Pattern Analysis**:
```java
while (temperature < -50 || temperature > 60) {
    System.out.println("[ERROR] Temperature must be between -50°C and 60°C");
    System.out.print("Please enter a valid temperature: ");
    temperature = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextLine().trim());
}
```

This demonstrates **defensive programming** - anticipating and handling edge cases to ensure data quality.

## Weather-Based Automation Logic

```java
public void showCurrentWeatherWithSuggestions() {
    if (currentUserWeather == null) {
        System.out.println("No weather data available. Please update weather information first.");
        return;
    }

    displayCurrentWeather();
    generateAutomationSuggestions();
}

private void generateAutomationSuggestions() {
    List<WeatherAutomationRule> suggestions = new ArrayList<>();
    WeatherData weather = currentUserWeather;

    // Temperature-based suggestions
    if (weather.getTemperature() > 28) {
        suggestions.add(new WeatherAutomationRule(
            "High Temperature (" + weather.getTemperature() + "°C)",
            "Turn ON AC, Turn OFF Heater/Geyser",
            "High temperatures require cooling and reduced heating to maintain comfort"
        ));
    }
}
```

**Intelligent Decision Making**

**How the Automation Logic Works**:
1. **Data Analysis**: Examines current weather parameters
2. **Rule Matching**: Compares conditions against predefined thresholds
3. **Action Generation**: Creates specific device control recommendations
4. **Reasoning Provision**: Explains why each action is recommended

**Temperature-Based Automation Examples**:
- **Hot Weather (>28°C)**: Activate cooling systems, disable heating
- **Cold Weather (<15°C)**: Enable heating systems, suggest warm water preparation
- **Moderate Temperature (15-28°C)**: Optimize for energy efficiency

**Humidity-Based Automation Examples**:
- **High Humidity (>70%)**: Activate dehumidifiers and air conditioning
- **Low Humidity (<30%)**: Suggest humidifier operation for comfort
- **Optimal Range (30-70%)**: Maintain current climate control settings

**Multi-Parameter Intelligence**:
```java
// Complex rule combining multiple weather factors
if (weather.getTemperature() > 25 && weather.getHumidity() > 65) {
    suggestions.add(new WeatherAutomationRule(
        "Hot & Humid Conditions",
        "AC + Dehumidifier + Fan for air circulation",
        "Combined temperature and humidity require comprehensive cooling approach"
    ));
}
```

## Weather Forecast Simulation

```java
public void showWeatherForecast() {
    System.out.println("\n=== 5-Day Weather Forecast ===");
    if (currentUserWeather == null) {
        showDemoForecast();
        return;
    }

    generateRealisticForecast();
}

private void generateRealisticForecast() {
    WeatherData baseWeather = currentUserWeather;
    LocalDateTime forecastDate = LocalDateTime.now().plusDays(1);

    for (int day = 1; day <= 5; day++) {
        // Generate realistic variations based on current weather
        double tempVariation = (random.nextDouble() - 0.5) * 6; // ±3°C variation
        double newTemp = baseWeather.getTemperature() + tempVariation;

        // ... continue generating forecast data
    }
}
```

**Forecast Generation Algorithm**

**Realistic Weather Simulation**:
1. **Base Weather**: Uses current user-provided data as foundation
2. **Controlled Randomness**: Applies realistic variations within acceptable ranges
3. **Seasonal Patterns**: Considers logical weather progression
4. **Automation Recommendations**: Provides daily device control suggestions

**Mathematical Approach**:
- **Temperature Variation**: ±3°C daily fluctuation using random distribution
- **Humidity Changes**: ±15% variation with bounds checking
- **Condition Evolution**: Logical weather pattern transitions
- **Air Quality Simulation**: Realistic AQI fluctuations based on weather patterns

**Practical Applications**:
```java
// Example forecast logic
if (day == 1 && baseWeather.getCondition().contains("Rain")) {
    // Tomorrow might still be rainy
    conditions = new String[]{"Light Rain", "Heavy Rain", "Drizzle"};
} else if (day > 2) {
    // Weather typically clears after 2-3 days
    conditions = new String[]{"Partly Cloudy", "Sunny", "Clear"};
}
```
